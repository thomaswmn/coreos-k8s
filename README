TODOs
* create service account private / public key pair on boot of master
* create other CA and keys on boot of master
* admission controller SecurityContextDeny is disabled here, but might be better to re-enable it
* define a clear concept which configs to hard-code in the fcc file and which to insert via mo
* same for config files - could use directory with configs instead of inlining them in the examle.fcc
